                Environmental issues are the harmful effects of human activities on the environment. These include

                Various environment protection programs are being practised with the aim of establishing a balance

                <h1>Air Pollution</h1>
                <div class="modal-text">Air pollution is a serious health issue. Of the 30 most polluted cities in the
                    world, 21 were in India in 2019. As per a study based on 2016 data, at least 140 million people in
                    India breathe air that is 10 times or more over the WHO safe limit and 13 of the world's 20 cities
                    with the highest annual levels of air pollution are in India. Air pollution ontributes to the
                    premature deaths of 2 million Indians every year. Emissions come from vehicles and industry, whereas
                    in rural areas, much of the pollution stems from biomass burning for cooking and keeping warm. In
                    autumn and spring months, large scale crop residue burning in agriculture fields – a cheaper
                    alternative to mechanical
                    tilling – is a major source of smoke, smog and particulate pollution. (we can make graph from the
                    data abovie and sources of air pollution is another graph)

                    The combination of outdoor and indoor particulate matter, and ozone –
                    is a risk factor for many of the leading causes of death including heart disease, stroke, lower
                    respiratory infections, lung cancer, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The
                    Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in its Global Burden of Disease study provide
                    estimates of the number of deaths attributed to the range of risk factors for disease.1 In the
                    visualization we see the number of deaths per year attributed to each risk factor. This chart
                    is shown for the global total, but can be explored for any country or region using the “change
                    country” toggle. Air pollution is one of the leading risk factors for death. In low-income
                    countries, it is often very near the top of the list (or is the leading risk factor).

            <h1>Land Pollution</h1>
            <div class="modal-text">Soil pollution is a form of land pollution in which the soil’s upper layer is
                harmed.
                Overuse of chemical fertilizers,
                soil degradation caused by running water, and other pest control measures contribute to the loss of
                agricultural land,
                forest cover, and grazing pastures, among other things.
                Various Causes of Land Pollution are listed below.<br>
                <b>• Agricultural Activities</b> – As animal production grows, it becomes decoupled from crop
                production, causing normal
                nutrient cycles between plants, soil, and animals to be severely disrupted, resulting in the widespread
                use of synthetic
                herbicides, insecticides, bactericides, and fertilizers, all of which contribute to pollution.<br>
                <b>• Mining Activities</b> – Mining has the potential to pollute the air and water supply, damage
                biodiversity and ecosystems,
                and permanently alter natural landscapes. Mining harms the ecosystem by destroying habitats, causing
                soil erosion, and
                polluting surface water, groundwater, and soil.<br>
                <b>• Urbanization</b> – Intensive urbanization will exacerbate poverty by preventing local
                municipalities from providing
                services to all residents. Increased air pollution from concentrated energy usage has a direct effect on
                human health.
                Lead levels in urban air are elevated as a result of automobile emissions.<br>
                <b>• Nuclear Waste</b> – The soil is also contaminated by radioactive waste from nuclear research
                stations and nuclear power
                plants, as well as radioactive fallout from nuclear explosions. Since radioactive materials have a long
                half-life, they
                can survive in the soil for long periods of time.

            <div class="modal-text">Global waste disposal: Although most of the waste we produce is relatively harmless
                and
                easy to dispose of, some is
                dangerous or toxic and extremely difficult to get rid of without automatically contaminating land. As
                this chart shows,
                69% of global waste (gray slices) involves direct land contamination. A further 11% (black slice)
                results in potential
                indirect contamination—when incinerator ash returns to the land. Only 18% of waste disposal, involving
                composting or
                recycling, is "green" (green slices).</div><br>

            <div class="modal-text">
                • Reforestation avoids river and lake silting by reducing surface erosion and preserving the fertile
                topsoil. It
                prevents the soil surface from sealing and cuts down on the amount of rainwater that runs off. When
                compared to
                petroleum-based plastics, biodegradable plastics produce significantly less waste. As biodegradable
                plastics degrade,
                they decompose into nontoxic, harmless components. Just 32% of the greenhouse gases released by
                petroleum-based plastics
                are produced by them.</div>

            <h1>Water Pollution</h1>
            <div class="modal-text">Water pollution is said to occur when toxic pollutants and particulate matter are
                introduced into water bodies such as
                lakes, rivers and seas. These contaminants are generally introduced by human activities like improper
                sewage treatment
                and oil spills. However, even natural processes such as eutrophication can cause water pollution.
                Other significant causes of water pollution include:<br>
                • Dumping solid wastes in water bodies<br>
                • Disposing untreated industrial sewage into water bodies<br>
                • Human and animal wastes<br>
                • Agricultural runoff containing pesticides and fertilisers<br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="modal-text">The effects of water pollution are very pronounced in our environment. Furthermore,
                toxic
                chemicals can bioaccumulate in
                living beings, and these chemicals can travel their way up the food chain, ultimately reaching humans.
                Among the other types of pollution, water pollution has severe consequences on humans. For instance, in
                1932, a grave
                case of water pollution incapacitated the inhabitants of an entire city in Japan with neurological
                diseases and mental
                illness for many decades. However, the immediate cause was not apparent but was eventually attributed to
                acute mercury
                poisoning. Methylmercury was dumped into the surrounding bay and had ultimately bioaccumulated inside
                the fish. The
                local population then consumed these fish, and this resulted in the manifestation of ill effects and
                neurological
                diseases.<br>
                Other consequences of water pollution include:<br>
                • Disruption of the ecosystem<br>
                • Threats to marine life<br>
                • Increased risk of water-borne diseases<br>
                • Increases toxic chemicals (such as mercury) in water bodies<br>
                • Eutrophication<br></div>
            <br> <br>

            <h1>What can we do about it?</h1>
            <div class="modal-text">
                • Dispose of Toxic Chemicals Properly <br>
                • Reduce the amount of water you use<br>
